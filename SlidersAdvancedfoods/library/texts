    <EN>Crop that has been around for ages. Produces more food, takes a bit more CO2 from air. It used to be very strong on Earth, but became very fragile in space. Very senstive to temperatures and grows slower then typical veggies therefore more difficult to complete, but the reward is great. Advanced crop.</EN>

    <EN>Prepares a big batch of artificial meat. Takes even more CO2, grows longer, is more difficult to complete, but more space-concious. Pretty much as close as you get to industrial artificial meat production in limited space. </EN>
