Some advanced foods. Credit to Anatarist for base files and should be used with his greenhouse mod.

Currently:
-Potatoes used to be quite strong on Earth, but became quite fragile in space. They grow longer and are quite picky, but give more veggies in return . Worthy, if you can make it work!
-BAM: Batch artificial meat. Industrial process to create more meat per one go. It takes a lot longer, takes a lot of CO2, result is even more toxic, but you get that juicy juicy meat... you can always eat some bugs if you don't want that!
