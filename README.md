# Space-Haven
Hey! This is the place to get some mods for Space Haven!.
Most of the code work is done by piggy riding other people, so I give credit for all those good people who can actually code :P 


1 - Less water from ice.  Slight nerf from 5-to-1 to slightly more reasonable 4-to-1. A lot still, but not so horribly broken!  

2 - Foods mod. This should be used with greenhouse mod. Idea is to make slower-growing higher-yeild things to decrease the load on the botanist or increase the production which is great for both early and late game. 
Basic greenhouse food still feasable.
First are potatoes, which are basically a bigger batch of veggies in terms of content. Grow slower, take more CO2, but give more veggies. 
Second is bulk\batch artificial meat. Same idea targeted at late game and sustaining bigger crew. With greenhouse, growing meat is pain which starts in the midgame, BAM is more targeted at late game. 
Very toxic, man!
